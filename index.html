  <p>Contributions:</p>
  <p>Created user stories with size estimates and used these stories to generate metrics such as product size and product effort. Completed the development and target environments and functional requirements segments of the requirement spec. Constructed the website that will be used to track the progress and notes of the project.
 <p>Developer Notes:</p>
  <p>Sept 9: This was our first week working on the project and meeting with the customer, Mike Flamm. No real work was accomplished and the first week mainly consisted of getting to know the customer and thinking about user stories and future steps.</p>
  <p>Sept 16: I worked on the Requirement Spec assignment this week. It consisted of creating user stories and functional requirements for our project. I created the story points with the help of my teammates and wrote a good portion of the requirement specification.</p>
  <p>Sept 23: Figured out how to access the current database on AWS, HeidiSQL and mySQL. This wasn't overly difficult due to documentation from last years team.</p>
  <p>Sept 30: Started to look at inserting new data into database and worked on my ethics essay rough draft. </p>
  <p>Oct 7: Brainstormed as a team how to insert data from Canadian vehicle spec into the database.</p>
  <p>Oct 14: Attempted to make a script to get Canadian vehicle data into existing table; however it didnt work. Going to try to figure out a new plan. </p>
  <p>Oct 21: Created a new table within the database for the new data that we wanted to insert. </p>
  <p>Oct 28: All of the files had to be formatted differently in order to import them into the database properly. </p>
  <p>Nov 4: Made a demo to show during our presentation covering the new data we were able to get into the database.</p>
  <p>Nov 11: Worked on the coding assigment. Started working on PHP files and SQL queries.</p>
  <p>Nov 18: Created new login table in database. Wrote some SQL queries as well.</p>
  <p>Nov 25: I met with the other team to work out issues with the application connection to the database. Continued to write SQL queries within the PHP files.</p>
  <p>Dec 2: Gearing up for the final presentation. Wrapping things up with the customer and making sure documentation is good for future teams.</p>

  <p>Developer Notes:</p>
  <p>Sept 9: Met with our customer (Mike Flamm) and we discussed semester goals and got to know each other. No real progress on the project yet, as we still needed to get information from our customer.  Our group joined the DeltaV slack chat where we are now all able to communicate with each other. A sub group was created for the database team, and mike provided us with the previous semster groups website. We were also presented with a website that gave us about 48 years worth of car data. A lot of research was done on heidiSQL, mySQL, and AWS. Lastly, Work was done on the requirement/use case assignment.</p>
  <p>Sept 16: I worked on the project plan assignment and requirement specification assignment. I was reponsible for part b of the planning and estimating task (Develop a risk list), along with the introduction, project overview, and nonfunctional requirements in the requirement specification assignment. As for the project planning assignment, we all just worked on random parts on a google doc.</p>
  <p>Sept 23: Reviewed the data currently in the database and brainstormed methods on how we can build off of it.</p>
  <p>Sept 30: I worked on the draft for the ethics essay. Mike has talked to us a few times about data security, so we have been looking into that. </p>
  <p>Oct 7: Finalized my ethics essay and turned that in. Then I worked with my group on thinking about different methods we could use to merge the files with the current database.</p>
  <p>Oct 14: Work was done on inserting the data presented into the database. We have been working on a script to format and compare data efficiently, but it is not looking like it will work out. </p>
  <p>Oct 21: The format of the CSV files presented make it practically impossible to merge the data, so we are creating a new table with the respective attributes. All the new data will have to be formated to fit the current representation. </p>
  <p>Oct 28: Spent the week formatting files and inserting them into heidiSQL. </p>
  <p>Nov 4: Reviewing the data in the database to make sure it looks good. I think eventually we may try to split the trim out of the model in the current data, because that is how the other tables are structured. As for the demo, and for the application, we wont change it since we are all planning on using the data that is currently in the database.</p>
  <p>Nov 11: Worked on the coding assigment. Also looked into how to connect to our database instance using gitbash, which proved to be more difficult than i thought. I couldnt locate where the private key was, Austin was able to find it on the DeltaV github. I was able to log on to our database instance and view its directories.</p>
  <p>Nov 18: I started working on the script responsible for formatting the CSV files. Worked with the other group members to get think about how the login table should be formatted.</p>
  <p>Nov 25: I met with Brady on the other team to work out issues with the application connection to the database. I was able to create 4 php files that Brady was then able to use to get the app to connect to the database. After a while we were able to get the results that we wanted. I also continued to work on the script, and almost got it completed.</p>
  <p>Dec 2: Our group presents on wednesday along with the other DeltaV teams, so preparations for the presentation and completion of the maintenace was the primary goal. I met with Chase on the other team to work out some issues with the login and registration tables on the application. Was able to create a directory on our database instance for the login page and registration page.</p>

Developer Notes:
</p>
  <p>11 September: We've held our first meeting with our customer, Mike Flamm. We've established our priorities of work and gameplan for the semester. Our team is in charge of cleaning up and updating the vehicle database for the mobile app of Delta V Innovations. These tables need to be populated with vehicle data and be available for the mobile app teams to access through their app. Also, we need to expand the database for tables that currently do not exist. </p>
  <p>18 September: After a week of working, Mike informed us of another team that is working on scanning barcodes through the app and how they should store the details. We decided that they should access the information gathered from the barcode from the database rather than utilizing a google search. Our mission of the week is to get into contact with the other team and coordinate efforts.</p>
  <p>25 September: We've started runing into troubles with the database format and the new data we are using from the Canadian Vehicle Database (CVB). They are organized in vastly different formats and the database has different data on the same cars than the data from the CVB. We were wondering if we should replace the data with what we are adding, however, Mike has informed us to not replace the data and just add to it.</p>
  <p>02 October: Mike touched on the topic of Data Security and how we should address it. During our meeting we discussed the privacy of the workfiles and private information being sent up into the database. We acknowledged that hosting off of AWS provides very decent security on its own, but also noted that anything being sent up should be encripted by the app and the database will store the encripted files.</p>
  <p>16 October: Instead of trying to work through each of the several file arranged from 1971 to 2018, we came up with the idea to write a script that organizes and formats each file to the table structure seen in the database.</p>
  <p>23 October: Our script idea started off successfully at first, but we began to run into several issues when trying to merge the .csv files into the database tables. The main issues we noted were that the CVB had labled the vehicle data differently and lacked the amount of data we currently saw per vehicle in the database. Our concerns were brought up with Mike and we continued working on it.</p>
  <p>30 October: Work continued as normal. Updated Mike on our progress.</p>
  <p>06 November: We scrapped the plan of trying to organize each file and merge it into the database as there were too many discrepancies such as the ones mentioned before and the fact that even among the files some were organized in diffrent ways. The new plan we came up with and fulfilled was to add a new seperate table in the database and fill that one with everything from the CVB. For it to be handled on the mobile app, we noted that there'd need to be a button to access "more" or "extra" vehicle information to access this new table.</p>
  <p>13 November: Mike presented us with his "twist" for the assignment. We were told to include production of a login page for users, storage for data sent by mobile app, and a finished script that converts and organizes CSV files into the format of our database. For the login page we need to establish tables within our database for storage of users' information. We'd need to include login information and personal information for each account. For the script, we'd need to setup a script that can take new updated files about vehicles each year and correctly format them to update the database.</p>
  <p>20 November: We've made headway on our "twist" and informed Mike where we were at before the Thanksgiving break.</p>
  <p>27 November: We noted we were having issues getting access to the files in the database as they are locked behind a key created by last semesters team. We're awaiting response from them so that we can alter and create filew on the server. Coordinating with the other teams has also informed us to input several php files into the database to assist each other on our "twists." Once accomplished, we are going to verify that the app can be updated and can connect to the database.</p>
